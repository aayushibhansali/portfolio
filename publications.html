                    <h2>Trip Itinerary Planner</h2>
                    <p>There are numerous travel websites available on the market today that have as their major goal to give any travel enthusiast all the information about various areas that people may like to visit, but many lack clear navigation and may cause confusion for the users in this ever-evolving world. Using "off the self" data from the web, our study focuses on creating real- time travel itineraries. The suggested solution overcomes the current drawbacks by utilizing an algorithm that produces a real- time itinerary after optimizing a number of significant factors, such as travel time between points of interest, traffic conditions, and ratings of locations to improve visitors' experiences in a city.</p>

                    <h2>Cloud Security and Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Over the last decade, cloud computing has grown and evolved significantly. It provides cost-effective solutions as well as a wide range of adaptable services. Many businesses are using cloud services. Users mostly use cloud services to save data in a virtual environment.
                        Users have no knowledge of or influence over what happens in the cloud, and nothing in the cloud is visible to them, which raises security and privacy problems. Malicious administrators can mess with the integrity, privacy, virtual machines, and volatile confidentiality of cloud services. Clouds are vulnerable to hacking, and their integrity, availability, and data security are all in jeopardy.
